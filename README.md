Ultrasound Toolkit - UsTk-1.0.0

Copyright (C) 2014 by Inria.

This project is using the CMake build system.

CMake is a complete stand-alone platform-independant build-system 
replacing autotools (autoconf/autoheader/automake/libtools) completely. 
It depends just on installed cmake (tested with cmake cvs version). It
needs a cmake 2.6.x or more recent version of cmake.
See http://www.cmake.org for details.

USAGE:
=====

1. On Unix platforms:

cd <ustk build dir>
ccmake <ustk source dir>
make
make install

2. On Windows, use the CMake GUI.
