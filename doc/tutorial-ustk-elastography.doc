\section intro_ustk_elastography Introduction

This tutorial expains how to perform elastography task on RF image coming through the network (with virtual server in this tutorial). 

\section ustk_elastography_basics How does elastography works ?

The elastography computation requires 2 RF input images. The process estimates the axial displacements of the RF samples per blocks in the image, and produces the strain map of the tissues based on those displacements.

\section ustk_elastography_run Running the tutorial

To run the tutorial, you have to run first the virtual server application to send a RF palpation sequence contained in ustk-dataset repository (https://github.com/lagadic/ustk-dataset), from ustk build directory:
\code
$ ./apps/ustk/virtual-server/ustk-virtualServer --input /path/to/ustk-dataset/RFElasto
\endcode
This application will send the RF sequence through TCP to the client. The client is the tutorial main application, here is the source code:

\include tutorial-elastography-2D.cpp

You can see that the ROI selection is hard-coded, it is intentionnally done to perform the elastography on a region with huge diferences in tissues stiffness. The ROI is the region contained in the red rectangle in the first display. The second display shows the elastography result: hard tissues are in black, and soft ones in whithe.

You can run it once the virtual server is correctly running, from ustk build directory:
\code
$ ./elastography/tutorial-elastography-2D
\endcode
