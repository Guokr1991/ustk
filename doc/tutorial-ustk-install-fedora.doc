\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install UsTK from source on Linux Fedora. These steps have been tested with Fedora 26 (64 bit) distribution, but should work with any other distribution as well. 

\section install_fedora_required Get the sources

First, create a workspace in $HOME/ustk-ws that will contain UsTK and ViSP sources, build and dataset:

\code
$ export USTK_WS=$HOME/ustk-ws
$ mkdir -p $USTK_WS
\endcode

Prior to build and install UsTK, you have to download the sources. To achieve this, run the following command:

\code
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/ustk $USTK_WS/ustk
\endcode

Git will clone the UsTK repository a subdirectory of your home directory.

\section install_fedora_script Build UsTK using the installation script

The you can run the installation script for fedora:

\code	
$ sh $USTK_WS/ustk/script/install-fedora.sh
\endcode

This will download all thirdparties and build the library (it will take some time). You will have to enter your password to install required packages, and confirm a few questions during the process.

Once the build is sucessfull, you can install the library (ViSP with UsTK) on your system (optionnal). Simply run:

\code
$ cd $USTK_WS/ustk-build
$ sudo make install
\endcode
