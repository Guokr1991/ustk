In this tutorial you will learn how to install UsTK from source on Linux Ubuntu. These steps have been tested with Ubuntu 17.04 (64 bit) distribution, but should work with any other distribution as well.

Prior to build and install UsTK, you have to download the sources. To achieve this, run the following command:

\code
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/ustk $HOME/USTK_DIR/ustk
\endcode

Git will clone the UsTK repository a subdirectory of your home directory.

\section install_ubuntu_3rdparty Build UsTK using the installation script

Once the sources are downloaded, you can run the installation script for ubuntu:

\code
$ sh $HOME/USTK_DIR/ustk/script/install-ubuntu.sh
\endcode

This will download all thirdparties and build the library (it will take some time). You will have to enter your password to download required packages, and confirm a few questions during the process.

Once the build is sucessfull, you can install the library on your system (optionnal). Simply run:

\code
$ cd $HOME/USTK_DIR/ustk_build
$ sudo make install
\endcode
