\section intro_ustk_server Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install the UsTK ultrasonix TCP server application on a ultrasonix machine.
Requirements:
- Station type : Sonix touch / Sonix tablet
- Ultrasonix research SDK version : porta 5.6.0 or newer
- CMake software
- Visual Studio compiler
- UsTK and its dependencies, including Qt 5 (tested with Qt 5.5 on Windows XP with Visual Studio 2010).

\section ustk_server_build_configuration Configuration of the build 

First login to the Ultrasonix machine.

Then install Qt 5.5 for MSVC 2010 on the Ultrasonix machine. You may [download](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.5/5.5.0/) `qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2010-5.5.0.exe` and double click on this file to start installation.

Next, download Ultrasonix SDK on <a href="http://research.ultrasonix.com/">Ultrasonix research website</a>, and extract it on a location of your choice (`C:/Ultrasonix` for example). Add a new environment variable to your windows system called `PORTA_DIR`, and pointing on the porta directory of the SDK (`C:/Ultrasonix/SDK/porta` for example). To this end, open a `cmd.exe` terminal and run: 
\code
C:\> setx PORTA_DIR C:\Ultrasonix\SDK\porta
\endcode

If not already done, install [CMake](https://cmake.org/). 

You may now download ViSP and UsTK source codes:

- Create a workspace folder and enter in this folder

		$ mkdir <workspace>; cd <workspace>

- Download ViSP and UsTK sources codes

		$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp
		$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/ustk

- Make a build directory (where UsTK and ViSP will be compiled together)

		$ mkdir visp-ustk-build; cd visp-ustk-build

Then you can configure the project using CMake: 
- Run `cmake-gui`, and specify the source directory of ViSP (`<workspace>/visp`), and put the build directory (`<workspace>/visp-ustk-build`).
- In the `VISP_CONTRIB_MODULES_PATH` option, enter the location of UsTK source code (`<workspace>/ustk`).
- Click "Configure" button, and verify that porta and Qt have been found correctly with CMake checking that cmake option `USE_QT5` is true and `PORTA_LIBRARIES` is correctly filled with your path.
- Set `Porta_LICENSE_PATH` variable to the path that contains `licenses_web` file generally located in `C:/Ultrasonix/SDK/porta/license`
- Click "Generate" button

If all went well the configuration step is OK, you can move on to compilation step.

\section ustk_server_build Build the application

To build the application, there are two ways:

1. Double click on `<workspace>/visp-ustk-build/VISP.sln` solution file in order to open the whole ViSP solution in Visual Studio. Then select **Release** in configuration manager, scroll to `ustk-ultrasonix-server` Visual Studio project and built this project.

2. Or open directly `ustk-ultrasonix-server.sln` Visual Studio solution located in `<workspace>/visp-ustk-build/apps/ustk/ultrasonix-server` folder. Once opened in Visual Studio 2010, select **Release** in configuration manager and build the project.

If the build is successful, you can now run the server application located in `<workspace>/visp-ustk-build/apps/ustk/ultrasonix-server/Release/ustk-ultrasonix-server.exe` (see below).

\section ustk_server_tips_tricks Tips & Tricks

Here are some advices to resolve some known issues in particular use of the application.

\subsection ustk_server_tips_tricks_imaging_modes Compile error with porta 6

If you are using porta 6 SDK, you will probably face a compile issue in the header file provided by Ultrasonix (porta_wrapper.h) : unknown type name 'imagingModes'.
This error is due to a missing header file : imagingModes.h. Simply include this header in porta_wrapper.h to correct the issue.

\subsection ustk_server_tips_tricks_init_usm_pci Porta hardware initialization error

If you are using a sonixtouch station, you'll have to change the default parameters to initialize porta. With this hardware, the usm and pci version have to be set to 4 (the default values in the server application are 3 as we use a previous hardware).
To set those values, you can use the --pci and --usm options as follow:
\code
C:\...> ustk-ultrasonix-server.exe --usm 4 --pci 4
\endcode
This will solve the initialization issues for sonixTouch stations.

\section ustk_server_run Running the server application

Before running the application, verify that a ultrasound probe is connected to your station, and that your station is connected to a network.
To run the application simply run the executable `ustk-ultrasonix-server.exe` generated in your build directory.
In a console, you will see the following messages: <br>

\code
C:\...> ustk-ultrasonix-server.exe
porta instance created
TCP server Started
Server now listening on port# 8080
\endcode

Now should appear a window asking "Do you want to keep blocking this program ?". Click on button "Unblock".

The server running on Ultrasonix Station is now ready.

On Ubuntu, you can run clients that are already provided as tutorials in:
- `<visp-ustk-build>/tutorial/ustk/ultrasonix/tutorial-ultrasonix-qt-grabbing-RF` to grab RF 2D images
- `<visp-ustk-build>/tutorial/ustk/ultrasonix/tutorial-ultrasonix-qt-grabbing-pre-scan` to grab pre-scan 2D images
- `<visp-ustk-build>/tutorial/ustk/ultrasonix/tutorial-ultrasonix-qt-grabbing-post-scan` to grab post-scan 2D images

Other examples are provided in the same folder.

\subsection ustk_server_run_probe_settings Use custom probes
In our lab, ustk server application is used with 5 probes only (C5-2, BPL9-5, BPC8-4, bi-plane, and 4DC7-3). So default imaging parameters are set from xml settings files provided by ultrasonix in our server application.
If you want to use some other probes, you can prepare a file to link probe ids with ultrasonix imaging pararameters config filenames. Here is an example of config file content:
\code
10 FAST-General (C5-2 60mm).xml
12 GEN-General (BPL9-5 55mm).xml
13 GEN-General (BPC8-4 10mm).xml
14 GEN-General (PAXY).xml
15 GEN-General (4DC7-3 40mm).xml
\endcode
This is the default configuration of the application if no config file is provided.

Once your file (let's call it probeParameters.txt) is created, put it near ustk-ultrasonixServer binary. Then in a console, go into ustk-ultrasonixServer binary folder and run:
\code
ustk-ultrasonix-server.exe --probeSettingsFile probeParameters.txt
\endcode

This will take into account your imaging parameters file corresponding to the probe plugged when you initialize the server application.
