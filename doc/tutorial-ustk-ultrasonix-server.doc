\section intro_ustk_server Introduction

This tutorial expains how to install the UsTK ultrasonix TCP server application on a ultrasonix machine.
Requrements:
- Station type : Sonix touch
- Ultrasonix research SDK version : porta 5.6.0 or newer
- CMake softare
- A C++ compiler (the software is tested on Visual Studio 2010)
- UsTK and its dependencies, including Qt 5 (tested with qt 5.5 on windows xp with Visual Studio 2010).

\section ustk_server_build_configuration Configuration of the build 

First you will need to download UsTK and ViSP source codes, and install Qt 5 for Visual Studio 2010 on the machine (click <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">here</a> to download).

Then, download Ultrasonix SDK on <a href="http://research.ultrasonix.com/">Ultrasonix research website</a>, and extract it on a location of your choice ("C:/Ultrasonix" for example). Add a new environment variable to your windows system called "PORTA_DIR", and pointing on the porta directory of the SDK ("C:/Ultrasonix/SDK/porta" for example).

Then you can configure the project using CMake: 
- Run cmake-gui, and specify the source directory of ViSP, and put the build directory of your choice.
- In the VISP_CONTRIB_MODULES_PATH option, enter the location of UsTK source code.
- Click "Configure", and verify that porta and Qt have been found correctly with CMake (verify that cmake option "USE_QT5" is true and "PORTA_LIBRARIES" is correctly filled with your path).
- Click "Generate"

If all went good the configuration step is OK, you can move on to compilation step.

\section ustk_server_build Build the application

Open "ustk-ultrasonix-server" Visual Studio solution, generated by CMake in your binary directory, under "apps/ustk/ultrasonix-server" folder.
Once the project opened in Visual Studio 2010, you can build it.

If the build was successful, you can now run the server application (see below).

\section ustk_server_run Running the server application

Before running the application, verify that a ultrasond probe is connected to your station, and that your station is connected to a netork.
To run the application simply run the executable "ustk-ultrasonix-server.exe" generated in your build directory.
In a console, you will see the following messages: <br>

\code
porta instance created
TCP server Started
Server now listening on port# 8080
\endcode
